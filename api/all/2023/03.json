It gets harder as I push farther. I need to finish it next week, then I can start the BigFrontEnd.dev.\n\nI tried HoloFit this week, a VR fitness app. It supports devices with FTMS bluetooth support which is a small bluetooth beacon that can be attached to a bike. But be careful not all the beacons supports FTMS. The first one I bought only support an App called Yingerjian. Nice App, but not exactly what I wanted. the FTMS bluetooth device also supports Zwift. But as I paddle the App had no response. I checked the documents, it was a mess, but I suppose I will develope an App of it oneday.","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"plan"}},{"id":"2023/03/09/RiftCat-a-cardboard-VR-headset.md","slug":"2023/03/09/riftcat-a-cardboard-vr-headset","body":"# RiftCat: a cardboard VR headset\n\nI used to have a cardboard VR headset. It is always a cheap and fun way to experience VR. I think there should one solution to use it to experience steam VR. By using RiftCat, you can use your phone to experience steam VR. But only for 5min.

But I found [Skybox lab](https://skybox.blockadelabs.com/), It fulfills my need, I can use the image in Immersed VR.
