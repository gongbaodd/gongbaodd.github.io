After some research, I have to use wifi-direct in Immersed VR. Simple, if you have a PC, you can set up a hotspot and connect your Headset to the hotspot. But in Mac, the hotspot feature is used by airdrop. I can try the ethernet, and share the internet with the headset using wifi. Or I can buy a USB wifi adapter as a Wifi2.\n\nI bought CF-812AC, using an opensource solution on Github written by [chris1111](https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter). The driver emulates the chip as an ethernet cable. It needs to disable SIP in recovery mode. In conclusion, The driver works fine, I can share my internet now, but in 2.4GHz. So the better idea is to add AP feature in the driver. It costs time... Now, I'm using a PC to set hotspot for the Mac and the headset.\n\nAbout AI, I subscribed copilot this week. Yes, it may not replace my job, but someone with an AI will.\n","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"plan"}}]}
