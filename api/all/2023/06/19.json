I learnt a lot about how to make a VScode extension. But it turns out I can just simply add some keyboard bindings on the wheel settings. This [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/input/windows-wheel-interactions) is about these settings. And this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Input.RadialController?view=winrt-22621) talks about develop an C# APP.\n\n[These](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) are the samples about making a VSCode extension.\n\nAnd there are some cool surface dial compatible open-source projects. [X-Knob](https://github.com/SmallPond/X-Knob). The [code](https://github.com/SmallPond/X-Knob) about sending Dial BLE signals might be useful.\n\n## TODOs on Rust\n\nThis week I bumped to an idea about graphql over FFI. I found some one published a [post](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/611516673) on ZhiHu.\n\nFound a document about how to use Rust on Android, [Link](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/android.html).\n\n## Three.js or Babylon.js\n\nI checked a new [tutorial](https://sbcode.net/react-three-fiber/) about R3F. R3F has a component project called [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei). But still, I think babylon.js has more build tools. And more [features](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features).\n\nI has been following a [guide project](https://doc.babylonjs.com/guidedLearning/createAGame\n), it's pretty old. I want to use react to refactor it.\n\nFound a [blog](http://louardongames.blogspot.com/search/label/Lessons%20from%20Suzy%20Cube) about game develop.\n\n## SwiftUI and RN\n\nAfter WWDC, I think it's time to learn some SwiftUI. I watched a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvLxxV7X1Is&list=PLuoeXyslFTubw4NtepDCis5tTqK37zT3Q&ab_channel=PaulHudson) from Paul Hudson. Swift is an interesting language, I will dig further.\n\nAlso I checked out a tutorial about [React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur6I5m2nTvk&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ&pp=iAQB), pretty simple.\n\n## The LAN does not work on Mac\n\nI found my LAN driver can not work on Mac OS.\n\n## ssh login WSL2\n\nThis is a [link](https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/wsl-ssh-access.html) about how to remotely login WSL2.\n","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"plan"}}]}
