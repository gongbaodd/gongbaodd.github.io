For network, just use the physical one.\n\nUsing Chat GPT to format some of my old posts, got some experience on it. Firstly, I want GPT to finnish my whole work, it did not work well. THen I tried to separate it into multiple parts, it worked well.\n\nThis week, Clash for windows was deleted from github.com, then clash core was deleted, too. I used new bing to make two sad blue cat to memorize it.\n\nMy home spinning bike was broken, I fixed it poorly, sad.","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"plan","tag":["browser","Hyper-V","GPT","Clash","spinning bike"]}},{"id":"2023/11/05/growgen-rebuild-todos.md","slug":"2023/11/05/growgen-rebuild-todos","body":"\n# GrowGen.xyz Rebuild Todos\n\n- Home Page Profile\n- Home Page Octopus Menu\n- Home Page Tags background\n- Header\n- Footer\n- Blog Page Profile\n- Blog Page List\n- Blog Page Selector\n","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"tech"}},{"id":"2023/11/11/45th-week-double-11s.md","slug":"2023/11/11/45th-week-double-11s","body":"\n# Week 45: 2023年双十一\n\n## What I bought\n\nBougt a GaN charger, because I do not have enough type-c charger. \n\n## Astro\n\nTurns out there are a lot strict rules in astro, for instance, [RSS feed rules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/rss#rssfeeditem). The web world is becoming more and more strict. I kind like how it goes. \n\n### Katex on Astro\n\n[This blog](https://ileumas.com/writing/2022/03/astro-math-katex/) shares the config to use katex on astro. The latest version is not correct, should use the correct `remark-math` package for `remark`.\n\n## Remark\n\nBy reading [Awesome Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/awesome-remark), found some interesting plugins.\n\n\n## Apple Watch & React Native\n\nJust a little research, here is the [link](https://www.coditation.com/blog/guide-101-apple-watch-app-development-and-integration-with-react-native?ssp=1&darkschemeovr=1&setlang=en-US&safesearch=moderate).\n\n## Proxmox\n\nProxmox is a VM that can share the GPU with the host.

Even though many praise are given to the last episode, I still think it is far from the animation pantheon. Loki will not appear in the future. The writer just give a good ending to the audience most loved character.\n\n## Pantheon\n\nI like the ending. It looks like written by Liu Ci Xin, the writer of The Three Body Theory.\n\n## Gen V\n\nThis is the first season of Gen V. Well, just like The Boys. Many blood scene, like it.\n\n## Quiz Lady\n\nA movie about sisterhood. warm and funny.\n\n## Scavengers Reign\n\nAn animation about human landing on a foreign planet. Great music, still many questions to be answered.","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"tv","tag":["loki","pantheon","gen-v","quiz-lady","scavengers-reign"]}}]}
