Well, as a visual engine, size is not a big issue. But I started to check some [R3F examples](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/examples) now.\n\nI tried Babylon.js' node editor.

Kind like babylon inspector.\n\n## Stable Diffusion\n\n[Fantasia 3D](https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/Fantasia3D) and [Dream Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIgDbBTztUM&ab_channel=NerdyRodent) are tools to build 3D assets.\n\n[Dream shaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IntRn96C4l4&ab_channel=Technonator) is to build special QR Code.\n\n## CSS\n\n[现代 CSS 你知道多少](https://w3cplus.medium.com/%E7%8E%B0%E4%BB%A3-css-%E4%BD%A0%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E5%A4%9A%E5%B0%91-8f21c3aea806)\n\n## React\n\n[React Graph Library](https://www.react-graph-gallery.com/) uses react and D3 to draw graphs.\n\n[shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is a UI library based on Radix.\n\n## Favicon\n\n[A blog](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) about how to add favicon to a website in 2023.\n\n## WSL\n\nI can't call vscode from WSL.
