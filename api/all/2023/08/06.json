Which was as a tutorial to learn shader in babylonjs.\n\nraczzalan.webgl-glsl-editor is an extension for vscode to write glsl without a language server.\n\nUsing a shader material is simple, just pass ther vertex and fragments as a parameter.\n\n```jsx\n        <sphere name=\"fireworks\" ref={setSphere}>\n            <shaderMaterial name=\"fireworks-mat\"\n                ref={setMat}\n                shaderPath={{vertexSource, fragmentSource}}\n                options={{\n                    attributes: [\"position\", \"normal\", \"uv\"],\n                    uniforms: [\"worldViewProjection\", \"time\"],\n                    needAlphaBlending: true,\n                }}\n                backFaceCulling={false}\n            />\n        </sphere>\n```\n\nthe attributes and uniforms are the variables that can be used in the shader. There are some varaibles that are automatically passed to the shader, like `worldViewProjection` and `time`. They are documented in [threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/ShaderMaterial) and [babylonjs](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/materials/shaders/introToShaders).\n\nattribute is the data passed before compile and uniforms can be changed during rendering.\n\nThere are two functions to send attributes. `mesh.setVerticesBuffer` and `mesh.registerInstancedBuffer`. The first one is for the data that is the same for every vertex, this is a simple [example](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#QCLQFN#39), like the position of the vertex. The second one is for the data that is different for every instance, This is the [example](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#8L50Q3#203).\n\n\n```js\nconst centroidBuffer = new Buffer(engine, centroid, false, 3)\nconst centroidVBuffer = centroidBuffer.createVertexBuffer(\"center\", 0, 3)\nmesh.setVerticesBuffer(centroidVBuffer)\n\nmesh.registerInstancedBuffer(\"direction\", 3)\nmesh.instancedBuffers.direction = directionBuffer\n```\n\nsending uniforms is simple. Like `material.setFloat(\"time\", time)`. Sadly the animation in babylon has not support shader material.\n\nNext week, I will try to learn how to use the node editor with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0PXzE1hJXg&ab_channel=Babylonjs).","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"plan"}}]}
