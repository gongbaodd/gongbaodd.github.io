The web world is becoming more and more strict. I kind like how it goes. \n\n### Katex on Astro\n\n[This blog](https://ileumas.com/writing/2022/03/astro-math-katex/) shares the config to use katex on astro. The latest version is not correct, should use the correct `remark-math` package for `remark`.\n\n## Remark\n\nBy reading [Awesome Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/awesome-remark), found some interesting plugins.\n\n\n## Apple Watch & React Native\n\nJust a little research, here is the [link](https://www.coditation.com/blog/guide-101-apple-watch-app-development-and-integration-with-react-native?ssp=1&darkschemeovr=1&setlang=en-US&safesearch=moderate).\n\n## Proxmox\n\nProxmox is a VM that can share the GPU with the host. Sadly, it could only work as a server, meaning that it need at least two machines.\n\n## Favicons\n\n[Real favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) packs a zip for all icons work for web and mobile.\n\n## Tailwind\n\nThis is a nice [cheatsheet](https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/) for tailwind CSS.\n\n## Share Windows fonts for WSL\n\n[This](https://x410.dev/cookbook/wsl/sharing-windows-fonts-with-wsl/) is a workable solution. Run `sudo fc-cache -r -v` to make it work, sometimes WSL need to restart.\n","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"plan","tag":["GaN charger","Astro","Katex","Remark","Apple Watch","Proxmox","Favicons","Tailwind","WSL","Fonts","React Native"]}}]}
