Even though many praise are given to the last episode, I still think it is far from the animation pantheon. Loki will not appear in the future. The writer just give a good ending to the audience most loved character.\n\n## Pantheon\n\nI like the ending. It looks like written by Liu Ci Xin, the writer of The Three Body Theory.\n\n## Gen V\n\nThis is the first season of Gen V. Well, just like The Boys. Many blood scene, like it.\n\n## Quiz Lady\n\nA movie about sisterhood. warm and funny.\n\n## Scavengers Reign\n\nAn animation about human landing on a foreign planet. Great music, still many questions to be answered.","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"tv","tag":["loki","pantheon","gen-v","quiz-lady","scavengers-reign"]}}]}
