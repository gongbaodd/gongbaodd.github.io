However, this stable version is the last one that supports Packer.vim. It means I have to learn Lazy.vim when the next version comes. I started using LazyGit, too. Like the authors' podcast btw.\n\nI also found out an app called BigScreen, which streams video to the VR headset so that the user can use it to watch movie.\n\nThis week, I compared ImmersedVR and VSpatial, VSpatial supports multiple devices, which is awesome, but only supports Windows. Yes, VR works better in Windows than Mac. I tried to configure Windows in Bootcamp. As I installed WSL2, it went blue screen. Guess I have to use Mac on my ITX for a while.\n\nSomething wrong happened to edge browser, all the chromium browsers occasionally cannot browse the internet. However, I am using firefox now.\n\nI still use TypeClub, I cannot find a better way but to learn touch typing. Although, I found KeyCastr on Mac and Carnac on Windows, which show key strokes on screen. They may be useful when I want to do some streaming.\n\nso next week's plan\n\n- Still need to do more typing class\n- Set up my account in WHV \n","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"plan"}}]}
