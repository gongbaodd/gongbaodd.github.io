Which was as a tutorial to learn shader in babylonjs.\n\nraczzalan.webgl-glsl-editor is an extension for vscode to write glsl without a language server.\n\nUsing a shader material is simple, just pass ther vertex and fragments as a parameter.\n\n```jsx\n        <sphere name=\"fireworks\" ref={setSphere}>\n            <shaderMaterial name=\"fireworks-mat\"\n                ref={setMat}\n                shaderPath={{vertexSource, fragmentSource}}\n                options={{\n                    attributes: [\"position\", \"normal\", \"uv\"],\n                    uniforms: [\"worldViewProjection\", \"time\"],\n                    needAlphaBlending: true,\n                }}\n                backFaceCulling={false}\n            />\n        </sphere>\n```\n\nthe attributes and uniforms are the variables that can be used in the shader. There are some varaibles that are automatically passed to the shader, like `worldViewProjection` and `time`. They are documented in [threejs](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/ShaderMaterial) and [babylonjs](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/materials/shaders/introToShaders).\n\nattribute is the data passed before compile and uniforms can be changed during rendering.\n\nThere are two functions to send attributes. `mesh.setVerticesBuffer` and `mesh.registerInstancedBuffer`. The first one is for the data that is the same for every vertex, this is a simple [example](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#QCLQFN#39), like the position of the vertex. The second one is for the data that is different for every instance, This is the [example](https://playground.babylonjs.com/#8L50Q3#203).\n\n\n```js\nconst centroidBuffer = new Buffer(engine, centroid, false, 3)\nconst centroidVBuffer = centroidBuffer.createVertexBuffer(\"center\", 0, 3)\nmesh.setVerticesBuffer(centroidVBuffer)\n\nmesh.registerInstancedBuffer(\"direction\", 3)\nmesh.instancedBuffers.direction = directionBuffer\n```\n\nsending uniforms is simple. Like `material.setFloat(\"time\", time)`. Sadly the animation in babylon has not support shader material.\n\nNext week, I will try to learn how to use the node editor with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0PXzE1hJXg&ab_channel=Babylonjs).","collection":"blog","data":{"type":"post","category":"plan"}},{"id":"2023/08/12/32nd-Autumn-now.md","slug":"2023/08/12/32nd-autumn-now","body":"# The 32nd week: It's autumn now\n\n## IELTS\n\nI started using IELTS premium this week.\n\n## Babylon.js\n\nThis week I found out that react-babylon.js doesn't support tree shaking, moreover, babylon.js is almost 4MB(1MB gzipped), it's almost 4 times bigger than three.js. Well, as a visual engine, size is not a big issue. But I started to check some [R3F examples](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/examples) now.\n\nI tried Babylon.js' node editor. [This](https://nme.babylonjs.com/#7FHE8M#1) is a toon shader inspired by [this article](https://roystan.net/articles/toon-shader/).\n\nRender a HTML to Canvas, it's better to have a height map. Can use [applyDisplacementMap](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#WUYDVT#6).\n\n## XR\n\nTikTok has an App EffectHome(橡塑 in China). Snap AR got a lot interesting filters. \n\nARkit supports [hand gesture](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10653/) already.
