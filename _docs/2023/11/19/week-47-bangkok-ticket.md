# Week 47: I Bought a Ticket to Bangkok

## Growgen.xyz

made a list of the things still left to be done in [the old todo file](../05/growgen-rebuild-todos).

### Astro language support

Astro uses [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md) as language syntax support. Still got `qml` and `planfuml` not supported.

### Astro Image support

There is an [image tool](https://astro-imagetools-docs.vercel.app/en/installation) providing more image support than the official one. sadly, it's outdated.

### Link rel

This is a [document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel) about the `rel` attribute in `link` tag.

### Vercel and Cloudflare DNS problem

The blog website is on Vercel. But the DNS got too many redirect. Just configure the DNS preference to strict in cloudflare. [ref](https://vercel.com/guides/resolve-err-too-many-redirects-when-using-cloudflare-proxy-with-vercel)

## CSS

collected some cool [css effects](https://redstapler.co/5-stunning-css-filter-tricks-you-must-see/).

## VISAs abroad

This is a [site](https://www.mr41.com/) about applying VISAs in China.

## ionic capacitor

A system bridge of web, iOS and Android.

## IIS server

This is a [tutorial](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-and-configure-iis-web-server-on-windows-server/) about setting up IIS server on Windows Server 2009.

## Ticket to Bangkok

About the Thailand plan, I will add more detail when I got the e-VISA.
