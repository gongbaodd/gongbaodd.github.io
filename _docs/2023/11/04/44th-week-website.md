# Week 44th: still work on the website

Got my HSBC card, it seem a PIN code still on the way.

Installed several "mainland China Only" browsers on Hyper-V, to install [windows XP](https://superuser.com/questions/1230652/get-official-windows-xp-virtual-machine-for-hyper-v) or windows 7 in a virtual machine, it's better to use Hyper-V. For network, just use the physical one.

Using Chat GPT to format some of my old posts, got some experience on it. Firstly, I want GPT to finnish my whole work, it did not work well. THen I tried to separate it into multiple parts, it worked well.

This week, Clash for windows was deleted from github.com, then clash core was deleted, too. I used new bing to make two sad blue cat to memorize it.

My home spinning bike was broken, I fixed it poorly, sad.
