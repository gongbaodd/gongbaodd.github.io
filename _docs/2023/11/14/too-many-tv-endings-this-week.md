# Too many TV endings this week

## Loki

No doubt, Loki is the best marvel series during and after COVID. Even though many praise are given to the last episode, I still think it is far from the animation pantheon. Loki will not appear in the future. The writer just give a good ending to the audience most loved character.

## Pantheon

I like the ending. It looks like written by Liu Ci Xin, the writer of The Three Body Theory.

## Gen V

This is the first season of Gen V. Well, just like The Boys. Many blood scene, like it.

## Quiz Lady

A movie about sisterhood. warm and funny.

## Scavengers Reign

An animation about human landing on a foreign planet. Great music, still many questions to be answered.
