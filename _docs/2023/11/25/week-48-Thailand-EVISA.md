# Week 48: Thailand e-VISA

## eVISA

I am still waiting the VISA to be approved. There are some [documents](https://thaievisa.go.th) to be prepared.

- At least 2,000 RMB in bank account
- Two tickets
- Hotel reservation
- Travel plan
- Passport Scan
- Personal photo
- Job status

## WASM

This is [an example](https://wasmbyexample.dev/home.en-us.html) about coding in wasm, quite too simple.

## ControlNet

Control Net is an extension for Stable Diffusion, which can generate an image with specific sketch style. This is a [blog](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/controlnet/) about how to use it.


## Topaz

Topaz is a tool for image upscaling. Not so good  as I thought.
