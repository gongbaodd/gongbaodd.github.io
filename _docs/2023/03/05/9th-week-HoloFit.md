# the 9th week: HoloFit

I'm not satisfied with this week's work, I didn't finish the typingclub.com. It gets harder as I push farther. I need to finish it next week, then I can start the BigFrontEnd.dev.

I tried HoloFit this week, a VR fitness app. It supports devices with FTMS bluetooth support which is a small bluetooth beacon that can be attached to a bike. But be careful not all the beacons supports FTMS. The first one I bought only support an App called Yingerjian. Nice App, but not exactly what I wanted. the FTMS bluetooth device also supports Zwift. But as I paddle the App had no response. I checked the documents, it was a mess, but I suppose I will develope an App of it oneday.
