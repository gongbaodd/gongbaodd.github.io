# 10th week Dev Containers

This week, I bought Virtual Desktop to try Steam VR. I also tried to use the Dev Container to develop the project. I found that the Dev Container is very useful.

I bought Glinet MT3000, it will arrive the next week. Guess it can be an ultimate network solution.

I can use new bing now, perfect AI, free and useful.

I finished the typingclub.com. So the next week I will finish the BigFrontEnd.dev.
