# 23rd Week: Book computer deep dive

I read 计算机底层的秘密, it's literally a book like CSAPP, but has more technology and less caculations.

Differences between processed, threads, coroutins.

CISC and RISC， how CISI using hyper-threading to defeat RISC. That it is actually a RISC with multiple assembly lines in the chip.

How to use memory especially in multiple cores.

Saturday, I tried to wake up my old moto 360 watch.

Sunday, I learnt some swift language grammar from swift 100 days. I also tried kotlin, I doubt that some one can remember so manny language sugars.
