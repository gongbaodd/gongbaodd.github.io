# 19th week Google IO

Tried AImoji this week, using stable diffusion to generate emoji. Try [this video](https://t.co/IiWIS6MQJY) to learn more about training a picture.

Tried MRTK on Hololens, tried some quest demos, building a VR is fun, compiling time is a disaster. Want to try compile MRTK on quest, and learn some babylonjs.

Trie QWERT-learner to remember words, this week I want to finish it.
