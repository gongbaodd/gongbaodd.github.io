# using tRPC

[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) is a RPC framework for TypeScript. A lot people compare it with graphql. After using it, I found out that they are not the same thing. GraphQL is more like Restful API. tRPC is a package to build Restful API with TypeScript.

I suddenly realized that I can use GraphQL in cloud functions. Compared with Restful API, GraphQL can do many work with only one endpoint.
