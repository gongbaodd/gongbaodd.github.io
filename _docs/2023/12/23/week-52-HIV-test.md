# week 52: I did an HIV test

This week, I was living in Hua lan pong in bangkok. Sometime I go to the lumpini park near silom. After some research, I realised silom is a red light zone. And I can buy some PrePs, If I buy 6 bottle of TENO-EM, I can do an HIV test for free, costing 8900 BHT. Well, I think it's better to try once.

The clinic is called PULSE clinic, just under the bridge of Sala Daeng BTS Station. It looks kinky in the front. Only need some blood. After 20min, I got the results.

## Outdoor Gym

Turns out there are many outdoor gym in bangkok. like lumpini park, only cost 30BHT a day.

## Next week

Next week, is the last week of 2023. I think, if I'm lucky, I will find a condo that fits me.
