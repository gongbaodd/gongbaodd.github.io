# The 32nd week: It's autumn now

## IELTS

I started using IELTS premium this week.

## Babylon.js

This week I found out that react-babylon.js doesn't support tree shaking, moreover, babylon.js is almost 4MB(1MB gzipped), it's almost 4 times bigger than three.js. Well, as a visual engine, size is not a big issue. But I started to check some [R3F examples](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/examples) now.

I tried Babylon.js' node editor. [This](https://nme.babylonjs.com/#7FHE8M#1) is a toon shader inspired by [this article](https://roystan.net/articles/toon-shader/).

Render a HTML to Canvas, it's better to have a height map. Can use [applyDisplacementMap](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#WUYDVT#6).

## XR

TikTok has an App EffectHome(橡塑 in China). Snap AR got a lot interesting filters. 

ARkit supports [hand gesture](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10653/) already. This is [Dilmer's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toAb_q1R_jY&ab_channel=DilmerValecillos) about hand tracking using AR Foundation. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWyTf3USDCQ&ab_channel=samyam) is a beginner tutorial about AR Foundation.

## Three.js

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jgAcUKTyKw&ab_channel=CJGammon) is a video using both spline and three.js to create a website.

[Triplex](https://triplex.dev/) is an editor for three.js. Kind like babylon inspector.

## Stable Diffusion

[Fantasia 3D](https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/Fantasia3D) and [Dream Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIgDbBTztUM&ab_channel=NerdyRodent) are tools to build 3D assets.

[Dream shaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IntRn96C4l4&ab_channel=Technonator) is to build special QR Code.

## CSS

[现代 CSS 你知道多少](https://w3cplus.medium.com/%E7%8E%B0%E4%BB%A3-css-%E4%BD%A0%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E5%A4%9A%E5%B0%91-8f21c3aea806)

## React

[React Graph Library](https://www.react-graph-gallery.com/) uses react and D3 to draw graphs.

[shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is a UI library based on Radix.

## Favicon

[A blog](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) about how to add favicon to a website in 2023.

## WSL

I can't call vscode from WSL. Because I configured systemd. [This issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/8952) has the solution.

## ML

Happen to know HuggingFace's new ML framework [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle)

Google brings visual block and media pipe as tools for tensorflow.
