# The 4th week: touch typing

Most days in this week, I kept practising touch typing on typeclub. Now, I can type the alphabets better, but the symbols are not so good.

I haven't made a WHV account, I will do that this week.

I can't make hyper-V work on my ITX, so I can't run WSL. I can't find out why.

Tried Meta workrooms this week, Love the whiteboard.

This week remember the WHV account!
