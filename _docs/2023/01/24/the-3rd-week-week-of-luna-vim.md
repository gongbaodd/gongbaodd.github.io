# The 3rd week in review: week of the LunarVim

Happy Luna/Chinese new year!

first week I bought Oculus Quest 2 started my first experience in Immersed VR.

second week I built up an ITX started my self-made hackintosh.

This third week, I tried LunarVim, great nvim config, I finally can be a vim guy! However, this stable version is the last one that supports Packer.vim. It means I have to learn Lazy.vim when the next version comes. I started using LazyGit, too. Like the authors' podcast btw.

I also found out an app called BigScreen, which streams video to the VR headset so that the user can use it to watch movie.

This week, I compared ImmersedVR and VSpatial, VSpatial supports multiple devices, which is awesome, but only supports Windows. Yes, VR works better in Windows than Mac. I tried to configure Windows in Bootcamp. As I installed WSL2, it went blue screen. Guess I have to use Mac on my ITX for a while.

Something wrong happened to edge browser, all the chromium browsers occasionally cannot browse the internet. However, I am using firefox now.

I still use TypeClub, I cannot find a better way but to learn touch typing. Although, I found KeyCastr on Mac and Carnac on Windows, which show key strokes on screen. They may be useful when I want to do some streaming.

so next week's plan

- Still need to do more typing class
- Set up my account in WHV
