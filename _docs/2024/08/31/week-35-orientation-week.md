# Week 35: Orientation Week

It was a very fast week. Most things are about clubs in ESN. ESN is a school union in Europe. Study how to use the library. Because I don't have a TRP yet, I can't use it as a library card. And the school libraries were separated in different places in the city. However, the city is not big, libraries to libraries are like only dosens minutes. And I was so astonished that student can choose to exchange to any other schools in Europe. Then on Thursday, there is a cultural evening. I thought it was all about food and movies. Well, it is majorly music and dancing. So I danced for 2 hours.

On Friday, it is the information session for my study. Honestly, it is my first time to know a presentation can be made as a game. And my lab was like a playground with all kinds of game consoles. After the lab tour, It is opening ceremony. It's like a market place, a lot bands, a lot music.

After the ceremony, I went to Pirita Beach to drink some beer. The sun sets at 8:30 P.M. It is so enjoyable. Then I opened a bolt account, and called a bolt for my first time.

I realized the self cashier in the Rimi Supermarket has a weigh inside of it. If you know the Estonian names of the fruits and vegetables, you can weigh them self-served.
