# Week 31: Develop a Vision OS APP

Last week, I decide to work through Apple's [Develop in Swift tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift). Because I had already learnt Swift UI, so I skipped the Swift UI fundamentals part. 

The second part, the data modeling. Honestly, I don't exactly understand it. Too many encapsules. The APIs are simple though. Use `@Model` to decorate the models, then add `modelContainer` to the contentView. To access the models, use `@Query` to decorate the properties. To save data use `@Environment(\.modelContext)` to access the context. I think I don't understand it was because I was not used to it.

The third part, Windows in vision os. It is surprisingly simple. Only add a depth parameter to views. A little curious that they add a `padding3D` instead of adding depth parameter in `padding`.

[Reality Composer Pro](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/) is like simplified blender to edit 3d models and export to `.usda` files.

Next week, I will dig deeper in [this tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training) to learn more about testing.

## Olympics 2024

This Olympics opening ceremony is fascinating. Strongly suggesting to listen to [the latest episode of 井户端会议](https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/66a692de7349f7a55726f3cc).

## Deadpool & Wolverine

Good movie but not marvel jesus.
