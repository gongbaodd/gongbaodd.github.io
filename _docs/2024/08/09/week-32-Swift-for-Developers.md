# Week 32: Swift for developers

## End of the swift studies

This week I was following the [App DEV training](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training). During the time I found some problems booth from the vscode and XCode iOS simulator.

[How do I fix the xcrun unable to find simctl error?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29108172/how-do-i-fix-the-xcrun-unable-to-find-simctl-error)

The tutorial is outdate, but it provides a lot resources. Here are some links about more information.

Then I am going to do some research on bluetooth in Android WearOS. This project I found is to make the watch to a bluetooth 2 step verification device. 

[WearAuth](https://github.com/fmeum/WearAuthn)

Recently I read a document about using accelerometer data to train a squat counter.

## TV series

*Those about to die* Game of throne style story, about Vespasian Roman times. There are three lines, the Royal line is about two princes, Titus and Domitian, and four royal families compete for their succession. The wagon race, or should called the pilentum race. A legal casino owner, who earns money by secretly manipulate the riders. The gladiator line, a north african young man who was defending his sisters was caught to become a gladiator.

The ancient rome scene is majesty. But the CGI is terrible, especially the race and the gladiators' fight scene. The royal conspiracy line is convincing. The gladiator line is totally wasted. I guess the editor can not wait to end this line, especially at the very end of the story. Too bad, I really like its setting.

*House of the Dragon s2* Last season, the old king died, leaving two legal succession, the black queen and the green king. And the black queen's second son was killed by green. So this season, was expected to tell these story lines in the book. A son for a son, Twin fight, the death of the Queen who never was, dragon seeds and a battle the the black queen lost her first born. However, the story ends at the dragon seeds. Meaning the whole season only has one battle scene in the middle of the story, and the other times are talking. Very boring. Like watching a long preview of next season.

*Umbrella Academy s4* Surprisingly, the show has a season 4. Every season the umbrella academy is to save their world when unexpectedly destroy it. And finally find a new timeline to stay. This season, I guess the author want to end all the timelines. Multi timeline story is not suitable for Disney and certainly the author also can't. So season 4 is not watchable.

*Babylon Berlin s1* This is a German detective story happened in between of WWI and WWII. It will be season 5 in 2025. However, I heard that Hitler has not appeared yet. The main character, a detective who is searching one pronography with some politicians in it. During solving the case he found there are more deeper conspiracies in other cases.
