# Week 33: Before Istanbul

This week is my last week in China. Right now, I am in the Beijing Airport waiting for my plane to Istanbul.

I always wanted to write an Android APP to control devices' volume through bluetooth. Because my Samsung watch can not pair with iPhone. But now, I have changed one pair of ear plugs with volume control. Seems the requirement is solved. However I still watched some [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A41hkHoYu4M) on Youtube.

Another cool thing, I found this [AI enhanced Video doodle tool](https://www-sop.inria.fr/reves/Basilic/2023/YBNWKB23/), it works as a video editor to draw doodles in videos.

My travel so far, after leaving Dalian at 1:00 PM, with 5 hours' railway to the Beijing Chaoyang Station. This is a new Station, is not provided a underground. There are buses to go to the center city. The bus stops look like those from Shenzhen Bay to Hong Kong. No 413 is to the Airport Underground Line. From terminal to terminal, Dong Zhi Men. Only costs 1 yuan.

You can eat some food in Dong Zhi Men. Then go to the airport by the Airport Line to T3. It costs 26 yuan. Beijing Airport provides small train to go from terminals to terminals. The International Terminal is T3. 

After the train, it's the harbour check. This time is much easier than that in Nanjing. When they check my intention and cash carefully and asked why I did not leave straight from Liaoning.

This is still half of the journey. After arriving Istanbul, I guess a free meal will be provided. And then I will go to Estonia, my guy Karl, a school body assigned to me will be waiting for me.
