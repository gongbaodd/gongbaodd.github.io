# Week 38: European Parliament Role Play Game

It is a week full of studying. But I have got some new game ideas. 

- A digital board game, I decide to use ChatGPT as helper to make it work on p5.js. I decide to make it as my Digital Graphics and sounds home work. And maybe I will use it to do game jam.
- A pixel art maker, I found a JS library to make image into pixels, [pixelIt](https://github.com/giventofly/pixelit)

This Friday, I went to try the European Parliament Role Play Game. It is one of my Digital Learning Game homework. The game is like The Sims. The players play as an European Parliament Member of the four parties: Tradition, Solidarity, Liberty and Ecology. 

There are two issues.

- Make new water infrastructure to save water, it needs information system, new infrastructure and researchers. It need more budget by raising the water fees.
- Implanting chips for Identification. It is for security reasons to implant chips inside people.

I choose the water issue. Firstly, I got a decision, with 50m Euros and no agency. My party needs more, so we rejected that. 

In the middle of the game. There is a twist. An earthquake happened causing all the decision to be voted again.

Finally, all the decisions were approved.
