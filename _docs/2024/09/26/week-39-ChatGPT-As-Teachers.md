# ChatGPT as Teachers

Yes, today is also about studying Estonian and Russian. But more on AI side. Right now, both two languages are about the changes on the verbs. Except for memorizing the words and handwriting, I also have to deal with the pronunciation. Then I realized that I can use ChatGPT. 

I accepted it as soon as I was talking to it. Many people ask me to find a real person to practice. But I always feel embarrassed. But to AI, I didn't. The only bad thing is that ChatGPT is not offline. I need a fine network, that makes the performance better in Android than it on iOS, because the shitty signal of iPhone.

So I decide to make an offline AI. I can use LLama to analysis the content and whisper to transpile sound into text. And use system TTS to make a sound. I will figure it out next week.

I tried to use ChatGPT to help my handwriting. But I think it makes up a lot, I can't distinguish what is right and what is made up.

And yes, I am using LLama as my study companion. When I read something or I want some idea or I feel the idea is dummy. LLama, ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot are always my first choice to go to.
