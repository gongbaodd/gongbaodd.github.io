# Week 1: Shopping in Thailand

## Malls in Bangkok

### Seven Eleven

711 is everywhere in Thailand. Differently to China, most goods are cheaper. I bought some bento from 711, and it was delicious. But the quantity is not enough for me.

### Lotus's

Lotus's is a supermarket in Thailand. It is a little bit like Walmart in China. Normally I buy some fruits and sheets. It is the nearest supermarket to my apartment.

### Big C

Big C got the best bento. Sadly, it is a little far from my apartment.

### Foodland

Price is lowest in Foodland. But it don't accept alipay or wechat pay.

### Tops

Tops is beside Lotus's. It is a little bit expensive than Lotus's.

### Shopee

Shopee is an online service like Taobao. It looks it has it's own delivery service.

### Lazada

Lazada is an online service like Taobao. Some time lazada provides free delivery service for overseas products.

## Boat Bus

I live near Asoke Pier. Meaning I can take a boat bus. It is a quick way to go to Siam. Only 14 baht. However, the smell on the river is awful.

## Nana District

Previously, I lived in Silom District. Because I like the gyms in lumphini park. I never realized that it was a red light district. Different to Silom, Nana is a typical red light district. They sell sex toys on the street(it was kind of illegal in Thailand). And the ladies will welcome you on the street. 

## Next week

I will make an app to calculate my cost here.
