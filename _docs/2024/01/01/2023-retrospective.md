# 2023 Retrospective

## What I did in 2023

I was using a quest2 and I learnt some basic unity tools. I find out a framework called Astro. I bought an ITX to use macintosh.

In the first month, I was working on how to work in VR, I finally use ImmersedVR and K375s as a tracking keyboard. In the end of this year, I changed to quest3, then I can throw the keyboard.

The 2nd month and 3rd month, I was majorly working on BFE.dev, great website, I think I will try it again in 2024.

The 4th to 6th month, I bought a GPU card and started to use some AI tools.

The 7th month and 8th month, I started try some WebXR development with babylonJS. Although, ThreeJS is the top suggested, I still think babylonJS has better wiki. And there is a prototype tool called Spine, I think I should try it in 2024. Also an engine called wonderland engine, I had to try it in 2024.

In the middle of the year, I bought iPhone and Apple Watch. I sold my ITX and some other gadgets. I bought a strong laptop,ASUS ProArt.

And in the end of the year, I went to Hong Kong and finally I got to Thailand.
