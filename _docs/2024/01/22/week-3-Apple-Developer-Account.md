# Week3: Apple Developer Account

This week, I tried to apply for an Apple Developer Account, but I failed. Turns out there is someone already used my ID card to registered. After trying about 1 week, wasting my Hong Kong number and two of my Thailand numbers, I still can not apply one for myself. I think I will give up.

## Some boilerplate 

Firstly, there's a template by [Nx](https://nx.dev/nx-api/expo) for expo. Tailwind for expo is [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/overview/). After compared with [solito](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-react-native-app-solito/) and [ignite]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOSvDlFyg20&ab_channel=Jamon%27sCodeQuests). I tried ignite, and it is amazing.

There is also a book about [monorepo for react](https://go.nx.dev/react-book), I will read it next week.

## Meta Spark Studio

Meta Spark Studio is an AR effect developer platform, which is used for instagram. But rumor has it hat ist will be used to develop Apps in oculus. Here is the [official tutorial](https://spark.meta.com/learn/tutorials/create-your-first-effect/). This is the youtube [tutorial](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk9ZoW1aLrw&list=PLk-TnRMdB7HBJG3qtcA1bayzoYW_eqLKx&ab_channel=MetaSpark). These are pretty old. I think I will try to learn it later.

To download the software, go to [this page](https://spark.meta.com/learn/downloads/).

## Expo .ipa files

Expo used to support building .ipa files, but now it is not supported anymore. I think I will try to figure out how. And then signing the app for personal use is easy. Just using i4Tools.
