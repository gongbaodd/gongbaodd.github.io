# Meta Blocks and Godot

## Meta Blocks

Meta provide a [All in One XR toolkit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-all-in-one-sdk-269657) to make building AR/VR app easier. You don't need to make many configurations to make an app.

Last week, I used most time to learn unity. I bumped into some problems. For the most time, I used to preview App. Turns out the compiled version is different from the preview one. So don't trust the preview.

## Godot

Another thing, because I kept get new pushes from godot. So I tried to use it follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XWyZblSnZA&t=264s) this week. Turns out to make a XR app is much easier than unity. The [documents](https://www.snopekgames.com/tutorial/2023/how-make-vr-game-webxr-godot-4) are clear.

Godot is cool, but since meta toolkit is easy enough. I will still use unity for a while.
