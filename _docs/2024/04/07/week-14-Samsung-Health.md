# Week 14: Samsung Health

## Health on wearables

This week I dig deeper on [the deadlift tracker tutorial](https://developer.samsung.com/codelab/health/deadlift-tracker.html). Turns out gym workouts like deadlift, squats are already supported on both [wearos](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/health/services/client/data/ExerciseType) and watchos. And samsung health has already supported.

But there are some movements were not supported. Like push ups, cleans, snatches and dumbbell curls. I guess it was too difficult to detect.

## WTF Academy

I was learning solidity on [WTF academy](https://www.wtf.academy/). Well, at least I learnt some thing to use in some interviews.

## Spotify Podcast

I just moved my podcasts to spotify. Because the free storage on podbean is full. Moving to spotify turns out not hard. It was formerly anchor. Now the hosting service is free with RSS support.
