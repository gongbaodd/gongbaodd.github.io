# Week 15: Songkran Festival

 I just came back from the Songkran Festival Parade held in Silom Road. Songkran festival is the new year of Thailand. In Thai, the April is pronounced as "Mesayon", sounds like "没啥用" in Chinese which means a month of no use. Yes, in this month, there are too many festivals. And this ia also the hottest month of a year.

The Songkran festival is all about water. People splash water to each other as blessing. Nowadays, the water guns are more popular. There are three major parade in Bangkok. The one in Silom Road is the traditional one. Khao San Road is the most crowded one. And the one in Siam is the most commercial one.

Preparation is important. A waterproof bag for the phone, a sandle, swim glasses and the water gun. Keep in mind that the water gun needs to be empty before entering the subway. If you don't want to buy water, you can bring a bottle and refill it in the water tank along the road.

Because the Silom Road is locked, I plan to eat in Sukunvit. The MRT station is already filled with people. Everyone is to Silom Road. I have waited 2 trains to get on.

The parade is along the silom road. The shoppers along side the road will provide free shows or free drinks. 

In conclusion. It's a fascinating festival.
