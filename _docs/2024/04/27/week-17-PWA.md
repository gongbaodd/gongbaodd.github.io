## Fallout

Fallout is a Game based TV series. It tells a world after the nuclear war. Three main characters, one from the shelter, one from the land and another was half man half zombie. I can't say it's enjoyable to watch, although many people recommend it. I am not fond of the art style, it feels like bad CG. And the story is easy to guess.
