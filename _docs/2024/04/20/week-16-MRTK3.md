# week 16: MRTK3

## Meta Layout

Meta finally got its toolkit application, [Meta Layout](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/9298251876913852/). Which uses the raydar to detect the environments and add ruler to measure the distance. And more, this App uses a new UI looks like it is going to be the new UI for quest. The UI add light reflection to the materials make it more 3D rather than 2D. However, I think the animations are not there yet, it feels toy like.

## MRTK3

MRTK3 is the latest version of the Mixed Reality Toolkit. I think it got better UI animation than the quest new UI. I tried to build it on quest 3. It turns out to be very easy. Just use the example template in the [repo](https://github.com/MixedRealityToolkit/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity).

BTW, if you want to try MRTK2 on webXR, here is a [link](https://rufus31415.github.io/webxr/MRTK-HandInteraction/). I have to say the web experience is not there yet.

The other thing MRTK provides is a testing tool. [localjoost](https://localjoost.github.io/Unit-testing-UI-interaction-with-MRTK3) wrote a blog about how to use it.

## ImmerGallery

Hugh Hou introduced a way to record Spatial video using quest3 in his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Odx5bNwdvOA&ab_channel=HughHou). It is actual a trick which uses screen cast to record. Because oculus did not provide any method to access the camera. ImmerGallery is a paid app, I have not tried it yet.

## Media Pipe

This is google's official [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axBwpKnVr4M&ab_channel=GoogleforDevelopers) for Media Pipe. Media Pipe is like Hugging Face's transformer.js. Which is a tool to use tensorflow model on devices.

## Surface Dial Android

I tried to figure out how to make a tool for surface dial. But I found this [feed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/1452i1u/surface_dial_in_a_web_browser/) on Reddit. Turns out some people have made an [Android Surface Dial Alternative](https://github.com/tumuyan/Kontroller).

I found [registry finder](https://registry-finder.com/), which is a tool to search keywords from windows registry. Sadly I did not found any thing useful for the surface dial.

## Tattoo101

I finished reading the book from [tattoo101](https://tattooing101.com/). I am thinking to make some practice on my own.

## Pasa Thai

This is a [document](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/27347280) about Thai characters.
