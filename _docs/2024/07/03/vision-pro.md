# My First try on Vision Pro

I tried Vision Pro in one of the Apple stores in Dalian. It provides 30 minutes vision pro experience.

Firstly, it is heavy, obviously heavier than quest3. And the magnet part is not tight enough to hold. The screen is way better than the quest3.

I tried five Apps, a game demo, photos, safari browser, 咪咕视频 and meditating. 

The dragon game, if you watched the vision pro commercial. you will know a butterfly would land on your finger. The headset knows the distance of your hands. Instead of showing two 3D hands, it cuts the game image to show the real hands. If you have used photo-shop, there is a function called feather. You can feel the hands are not fitting the environment, because the edge is clear. The butterfly can not exactly land on your fingers, it's like standing about my finger.

Spatial photo is stunning. I watched the birthday photo, it feels like a gaussian splatting 3D model. However it is not. There is a problem, because the screen is too clear, when I watch the video which was recorded by iPhone 15, I can see a purple edge on the corner.

Sadly, I didn't found the 3D model on the main page, I can not experience how a 3D model works in 3D models. Neither do I tried the keyboard. What I know, the GUI adds shadow at the bottom.

咪咕视频, because Apple TV is not available in China, this is a replacement. I realized a shortage of eye tracking here. When I was watching a video, my eyes and hands are not still. They move sometimes and that is not what I meant. And the device reflects.

Meditating, I tried TRIPP in quest3, however I think TRIPP is better. Meditating is more like a breath helper, and it only works as what video shows, there's no more movement like rolling eye balls etc.
