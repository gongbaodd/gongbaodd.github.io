# Week 28: Android 14 and Meta XR simulator

Most of this week I was working on trying new ROM on my phone and tablet. I have wrote another article about this. I tried to use Magisk to do some root stuff. Well, I lost the interests.

Another thing, I tried the Meta XR simulator this week. It is in the Meta Quest Developer Hub. When using Unity, click *Oculus* menu select *XR simulator* click *activate*. Then run the project. Interaction is like play a game. You can check the input binding from the menu left side.
