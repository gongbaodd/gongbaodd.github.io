# Week 29: Rent A Mac

This week I rent a Mac mini from 人人租. It's only 10 yuan a day. I rent it for 30 days.

I wanted to try the feeling of using a PC and a Mac mini as a server. And how it feels to develop Apple Watch Apps.

- You need an extra keyboard and mouse, without bluetooth support, which are used to login.
- Install ToDesk to make remote instructions, but it needs screen signal, a HDMI video capture device is better. 
- The watch, the phone and XCode need to be on one same Apple ID to connect.
- Debugging the watch needs both bluetooth and wifi connection. That's why the watch cannot connect my Hackintosh under bridge network. 

I bumped a certification error, it says "codesign 想要访问您的钥匙串中的密钥". Need to add develop access in the keychains. Instructions are [here](https://www.jianshu.com/p/4a58d4967b1f).

After trying to create a developer ID using my father's ID. And failed. I realized it is not possible to make an app on AppStore as a Chinese. I decide to sell my Apple Watch. And I checked some [android development platform](https://blog.csdn.net/Jason_HD/article/details/125972314).

Next week, I will redo [the swift UI tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) to make a watch app.

There are many official tutorials.

- [Develop in swift](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift)
- [App dev training](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training)

And I found a [website](https://www.50languages.com/en/learn/phrasebook/et) to learn Estonian.
