# Week 5: Expo Go

I wrote my first iOS app with Expo Go. Using ignite as boilerplate. Thanks to copilot, App icon and splash screen were made in less than 1 hour.

## MacOS in Windows

last week, I tried to use some obsolete Mac OS in Windows, I failed. If you want to develope iOS app, you need keep your Mac OS up to date. So finally I installed Sonoma on Windows. Yes, it is slow, but I think I will endure it.

## BTRfs

I use BTRfs in my Linux system. Recently, because I installed too many VMs in Windows, the storage is running short. Then I realized that there is actually a [BTRfs driver for Windows](https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs). And it was included in ReactOS. It works perfectly on Windows.

## TVs

I watched 宇宙编辑部, a lot people mentioned it. Good to watch, but not on big screen, too many moving cameras. 

I also watched DogMan. love the scene, when Douglas was locked with the dogs, there was a banner says "In the name of the Dog." but in his eye, it was reversed, "Dog" into "God".

## React Native Stuff

I collect some tools in React Native.

- [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/), Material Design for React Native.
- [Expo Example](https://github.com/expo/examples), a lot of examples for Expo.
- [ReactNative Directory](https://reactnative.directory/), collection of libraries for React Native.
- [Material Palettes](https://materialpalettes.com/)

## Cloudflare Workers

The original web-json-token cannot work on cloudflare workers. need to use `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt`, but it cannot work with [graphql-yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/tutorial/advanced/01-authentication), I still trying to make it work.

## Slow Tech Improvement

Even though vision OS was out. Firefox still don't support view transition. Strapi still not support serverless. Ionic is still SPA.

## Good Food in Thailand

 I found this crab stick salad in 711, nice to eat.
