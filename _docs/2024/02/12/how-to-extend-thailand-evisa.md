# How to Extend Thailand eVisa

My eVisa is about to expire. I can extend it for another 30 days. Just go to the Immigration Division. Bring your passport, a copy of your passport, a copy of your eVisa, a photo, TM30 and 1,900 Baht. The process takes about 30 minutes. 

Firstly, my house owner have already provide me a TM30, it says that I will live for 365 days. Many people ask me to provide the TM30 in late 5 days, but if you never leave Thailand then any time's TM30 is fine.

The offices of Thailand lies far away from the city center. Firstly, I need take the MTR to Bang Sue Grand Station, then take the BTS to Lak Si Station. There is a building called IT square. Inside, there is an office to extend VISAs, but for walk-in customers.

Mine is a eVisa, so I had to walk to the other building which is about 1 km away. The building looks majestic, quite like most government buildings in China. But after some checking, inside looks a lot like a super market, with food court and shops. If the documents are prepared, you can go to the 2nd door, on the right side is the immigration division. Just ask a number to wait.

To copy documents or take photos, the services are provided in the B1. Forms like TM7 are also provided there.

Some people provides help in the lobby, but they are not official. I met one who took me to IT square and got back. At last he ask me 4k baht to help me to extend the eVisa. I refused. The process is quite simple, just wait for the number. The officers are kind and helpful. It's spring festival, they are wearing red so the office is quite festive.
