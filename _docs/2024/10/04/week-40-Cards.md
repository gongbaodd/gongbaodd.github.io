# week 40: Cards

## SIM Card

SIM Card is very easy to get in Tallinn. R-Kiosk is the place to get them. It is like 711. If the SIM card is not on the shelf you can ask the owner. 

I bought a super SIM. The data plan is monthly, but you can extend the validity by charging little data into it.

## Green Card

Green Card is for transportation. Also can get in R-Kiosk. You can charge the card in [Pilet.ee](https://www.pilet.ee/). Transport in Estonia charges 2 euro every hour, top 5 euro a day. But with a resident card, all tickets in city are free.

## Resident Card

This is the card that every expat need to get in Estonia. This is the identification for citizenship. 
You can use this to make a bank card or use transportation free.

Normally, it takes 3 months to get the card. I applied in 21st August and get the card 4th October. 
After getting the card, I need to register my accommodation. Find a registration office or register with a card reader.
Simply upload the rent contract and wait for response.

## ISIC Card

ISIC Card is the international student card. It can also apply online. After two weeks they will ask you to pick it up in the office. 
Or you can use a virtual one. Except for the identification, you can also use it to get discount.

## ESN Card

ESN Card is for European student. ESN usually make events, with the card, normally can get 10% discount.
