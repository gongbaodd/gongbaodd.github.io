# Week 42: XR in Estonia

I went to [the XR Estonia meetup](www.realitiexpress.com) hold by [EEVR](https://eevr.ee/). It is a two days session. Because there was a class in Friday. I have to skip some talks. I only listened to the Game part and Digital Twin part.

My deepest impression is [Jeremy Dalton](https://jeremydaltonxr.com/) from PWC. He digged a lot of history of XR. Dome training in WW2.The accident that created 3D movie.

Then [Ana Ribeiro](https://x.com/anagamedev) told stories about her way from student to VR game developer. And made a studio on pixel ripped.

[VSight](https://x.com/vsightio) is like the game overcooked but in industry.

During the second days' session, I tried xReal ans vision pro. I also tried [7 sense](https://7sense.ee/) to help blind people to see the world.
