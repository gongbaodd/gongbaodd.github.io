# BinHai

## Applying D-VISA

I finished applying a visa to study in Estonia. Turns out I have to prepare following files.

- an applicant form
- an acceptance paper from school
- bank statements in 3 months
- a plane ticket to arrive Estonia
- an insurance
- 100 euro fee

Estonia Embassy in Beijing needs appointment online, the URL is pasted on the embassy window. After applying the visa, the passport will be sent to home by post in 2 weeks.

During the time, I ate Wu Sheng Lamb soup, it is cheaper, but meat is less. Also I ate Teacher Tian, not so tasty as I remembered. I went to The Place(世贸天阶), where was a site that I was always wanted to go. however it is not what I expected.

## BinHai New District

I changed my debt card in Beijing. Sadly, it needs at most 10 days to make the card (so slow). Then I plan to live in the cities near Beijing, because the cost to live in Beijing is expensive. 

As one of the ghost cities in China, BinHai new district is super cheap. The first hotel with a microwave and a wash machine only costs me 86 yuan per day, the second one with many electric furniture and a projector only costs 91 yuan per day. They are 1 third of the Beijing rent cost. However, the mosquitos are a lot, I need to buy a mosquito repellent in the middle of the night.

If I still can't get the card in Monday, I will try going to Xiong An New district, where is also one of China's ghost city with even much cheaper rent than Bin Hai.

## Stable Diffusion

Since I am moving a lot, I can not find a place to actually do some coding. So I tried to use stable diffusion to make some QRCode. I checked [this](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/qr-code/) article. Sadly my QRcode is not scannable.

## Learning Tattoos

Buying tattoo gun is easy, you can get one from websites like taobao or shopee. Besides tattoo gun, you need tattoo paper, transfer cream, ink, needles, fake skins and vitamin A cream.

tattoo paper is 3 layers, the middle one is for protection. The top layer which is the white one is to draw it will stick the ink from the bottom layer. And then, use the transfer cream to copy the stencil to the skin.

Tattoo gun is to trace the stencil and inject the ink into the skins. The vitamin A cream can be used to clear the stencil.
