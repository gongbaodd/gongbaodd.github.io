# Week 23: Asgard's Wrath

From Beijing's hot summer to the spring in Dalian, I am the only one wearing a summer outfit on the road.

## Asgard's Wrath

I decide to play Asgard's Wrath on my Quest 3. It was installed with Quest 3 when I bought it. But I have not played it for 1 year.

I have not pass the beginner part, but I like its interaction design.

Also, in this week I started to learn some article on [webGL3d.cn](https://webGL3d.cn). There are some applications of many mathematical theories.

## Correct way to do squats

I bought a 2 weeks entrance ticket from a local gym. After almost a year, I finally can do back squats with a bar. I think my posture was not correct. 2 years ago, my muscle was not big enough to realize that. I felt paralyzed on my right arm when I do squats. Then I found out that I should shrink my trapezius which is the back muscle upper near the neck. Then I felt much better.
