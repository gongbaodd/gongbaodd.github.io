# Week 24: Inside No 9

I almost finished nothing this week. Getting back home made me lazy or because my neighbor's TV was too loud, seriously the old lady don't know how to close the TV, I have to cut down her electricity every night. So this week I will talk about TVs seres I have been watching.

## Inside No 9

This is the last season of Inside No 9. For 9 years, this show told different stories in each episode. Every story dramatically changed at the end. The actors' acting was enjoyable. It is quite sad that the show ends this year.

## Dark Matter

This is a multi universe story. Jason was a physics teacher with a happy family. One day he was kidnapped by some one and was sent to a different universe, where in that universe, he was a famous scientist. Then he tries to go back his own universe. This season has not yet finished. There was a big turning point last episode, when the original Jason finds his way back home, a new Jason also went to his universe, makes the story more like Rick and Morty. The soundtrack is way better than the 3 body theory.

## The Boys

This is a super hero story, when super heros are products of an evil company. A team of normal people tries take down them. This is the 4th season of The Boys. The show will end on its 5th season. This season has been aired 3 episode. Not too surprising. However, I am still looking forward to how the story goes.
