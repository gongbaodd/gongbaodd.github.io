# Week 20: Thailand Retrospect

## What I did

Finally, I start to pack my bag to leave Thailand. I want to use this article to summarize what I was doing this half year.

First month, it is all about making an apple developer account, which is still not accomplished.

Then, the next month, I tried to make Apps using altStore. With which, I can finally install apps on iOS. Then I tried to make an expence tracker using expo and a Thai language study app using ionic.

The third month, I was intend to work on wearables. MAUI used to support wearables, but the support would end in a month. Yet I still tried a little. Then I turned to native development.

The Forth month, I tried some XR frameworks, including unity and godot, yet I still want to work in webXR.

This month, I started to prepare for leaving. During the month, I tried to learn tattoo in my spare time.

## What I did last week

Last week, I was trying to fulfill all the things I want to do in Thailand. I bought a durian, which is 200 Bhat, turns out it will be 200 yuan in China. I bought a bag of salak, which is called as snake skin fruit in China, it smells like smelly socks, tastes like jackfruit. I would not suggest a try.

Yesterday, I went to Talat Plu, which is a market near Wat Paknam. I heard there is a kind of ice cream that made with eggs. Sadly, I did not find it. However, I bumped to a festival parade. I think they were celebrating the birth of the buddha. The market fulfills all the image of a southeast asia market. Which is located besides the railway, small and low roofs.

Wat Paknam is located in Thunburi of bangkok. It used to be the capital of Thailand, however all the tall buildings were settled on the other side of the Chao Phraya river, kept this place more ancient and secret.

## What I think of Thailand

Super commercial, even the metro has market inside. You can choose different of metro cards, as a traveling country it is super friendly to traveler.

I use google map to travel, sadly, it's not the best choice. It used boat as a walking method. The user interface using Chinese and Thai, which is super useful when communicating with the locals. Chinese names are little confusing for locals by the way.

The public services are friendly to the disables. I can see many disabled people walking around.

The drinks are deep. Red bull is a Thailand drink which is famouse around world. I tried once, honestly, I can only drink it with more water.

Food in thailand is cheaper than in China. But you have to find out. I often go to terminal 21, where I can have a feast in about 100 Baht.

A year in Thailand is all summer. But the April is unbearable, that's why there are a lot holidays in April. After April will be a lot rains, so the weather can be cooler.

## Others

This week, I tried to use [msw](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) as a backend mocking service in testing. And I used [mediapipe's pose landmarker](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/pose_landmarker) to make a training counter. And I found this [Threejs 中文网](http://www.webgl3d.cn/pages/001888/) a great help in learning threejs.
