# Cashless Bangkok

If you own a Thailand bankcard, you can use Prompt Pay as payment, which uses QRCode as identification to transfer, like alipay and wechat-pay.

However, you should have a bankcard first. I tried to open an account in K-Bank. Sadly, because a recent corruption news, the bank cut down its account services for foreigners. Luckily, I finally opened an account in Bangkok bank. Fun fact, the bangkok bank was called 盘谷银行 in Chinese, 盘古 was a creator god in China. Well, as a result it was just a translation from the pronounce of bangkok.

Back to the card. To open an account in bangkok bank. You need to buy an insurance for 1 year. Then save 500 BHT in the card. It is a mastercard, it will charge 400 BHT yearly. After signing a lot papers, the staff helped me to install an App, which has a scan button at the bottom which can be used to pay in cashless.
