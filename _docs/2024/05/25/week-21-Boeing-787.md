# Week 21: Boeing 787

This week, on my way from Bangkok to Beijing, I was on the Boeing 787-9. I was firstly arrived at Kunming at about 1 o'clock. After 4 hours' sleep I caught up the first plane to Beijing, which is Boeing 787-9. It was my first big airplane, with two walk ways, and on flight wifi.

BTW, the bus from Beijing Daxing to Langfang is free, but there are 10km from the bus stop to Langfang downtown.

I am watching a TV show called Dark Matter. Another multi universe story, like Ordinary Joe. They all talk about single choice difference makes a huge life change. However, the three timelines of Ordinary Joe never crossed. Dark Matter is the other way. There are only 4 series now. I am looking forward to its further development.
