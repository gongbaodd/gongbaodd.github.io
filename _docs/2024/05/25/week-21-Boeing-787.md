# Week 21: Boeing 787

This week, on my way from Bangkok to Beijing, I was on the Boeing 787-9. I was firstly arrived at Kunming at about 1 o'clock. After 4 hours' sleep I caught up the first plane to Beijing, which is Boeing 787-9. It was my first big airplane, with two walk ways, and on flight wifi.

I am watching a TV show called Dark Matter. Another multi universe story, like Ordinary Joe. They all talk about single choice difference makes a huge life change. However, the three timelines of Ordinary Joe never crossed. Dark Matter is the other way. There are only 4 series now. I am looking forward to its further development.
