# 5th week: Get a keyboard

Well, I bought a K375s. Yes, I've gave up my touch typing plan. And I will keep practising it recently.

The Chinese WHV will take offer on this August. Right now I have to pick up my English. However, I just found out that China is a high-incidence area of tuberculosis. After what happened in Covid. It's like a joke.

I moved my develop environment to PC this week. The VR experience in Mac was not acceptable. Guess I have to buy a new router or wait for some software update.

I have too many plans this week. My English book is not here yet. Guess I will try some FE frameworks.
