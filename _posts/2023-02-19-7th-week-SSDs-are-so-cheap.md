# the 7th week: SSDs are so cheap

I bought an 1TB SSD for 288 yuan. It's so cheap. I'm going to use it as a Windows drive, leaving the 500GB to use Mac OS.

I finished three TV series this week. The first one is The Slow horses. It's a British TV series. The story is about a group of agents working for MI5. When the government made a mistake, they are the ones to take the blame. Good story and good acting. I like it. The second one is The White Lotus, a comedy TV series. It's about the vacasions and murders of hypocritical white upper classes. The third one is an anime called The Bad Batch. I liked it in the first season, but this season, the animation is not so good. Next week I will finish The Clarkson Farm.

I bought a second hand Huawei phone for my father. It will be arrived the next week.

I tried Tailwind this week. Also downloaded T3 project. I may need to figure out how to use prisma and tRPC. I'm trying to make a dashboard using systeminformation.

Fixed WSL running in opencore. Don't know how, I just copied some configs from daliansky.

Next week the master entrance exam result will be announced. Not so sure what to do next.
