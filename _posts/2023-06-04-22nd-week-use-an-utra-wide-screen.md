# 22nd Week: Use an ultra wide screen

I added web sync on qwerty-learner, it's now available on [this site](https://qwerty-ochre.vercel.app/).

This week I bought a lot fans to nake sure my devices can survive the summer. I occasionaly found out that with an ultra wide screen can pick up my efficency. I always wanted to split the terminal window from vscode, with an wide screen, that's not a problem any more. So I found [CRU - custom resolution utility](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU). It adds new resolution to the graphic settings, like 2880x900.

Rarbg was down this week, guess I can not watch many movies for some time.
