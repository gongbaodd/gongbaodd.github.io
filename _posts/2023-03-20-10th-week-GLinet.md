# 10th Week: GLinet

This week I mostly work on BFE.com, finished about 30% questions. Last week I bought GLinet router, a router runs openwrt on it, super useful.

I took Dalian subway line 5, nice new subway line, I like the station design.

About AI, I was going to generate 360 degree panorama image from 2D image, using AI to generate the empty part, but I found it's not that easy, it takes a lot token to do outpaint in either stable diffusion nor Dall-E. But I found [Skybox lab](https://skybox.blockadelabs.com/), It fulfills my need, I can use the image in Immersed VR. Hope one day I can set it up using voice commands.
