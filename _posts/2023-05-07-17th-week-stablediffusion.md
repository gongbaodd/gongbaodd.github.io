# 17th week stable diffusion

Got My iPhone finally.

- tried Memoji, can't generate one from my photo, sad. I can send it to wechat.
- iPhone don't have a complete file system, it feels a little different to Android. Meaning most time, I can't open a folder, create a file to edit. I can open an editor to write and then share to the file App.
- iPhone don't have a back logic, sometimes I want to swipe the side to trigger back logic, which is useful in Android, but it won't work in iOS.
- I can't capture a 360 panorama photo, the last App, Gogle streetview was removed from App Store.

Tried stable diffusion, generated some photo with my face, like it.

Did some research on XR, want to try some in MRTK. try the tutorial on babylonjs. About AR, 8th wall might be a starter choice, or I can try Unity's AR foundation, to make AR work on phones.
