# The First Week

This is the first week of 2013. A lot of stuff happened. I received Quest2 and started my first metaverse experience in Immersed VR. I have got my first ITX Mac device only for me. I upgraded my laptop and tablet to Windows 10 Pro.

Besides using a lot of time to set up the development environment, I wasted some time adapting to working in VR. It's like living in a place with a telescope on. Since I only have 2K pixels per eye, the resolution of the screen needs to be small, so that I can discern the characters. And, yes, my computer cannot afford too many high-resolution screens. I need to practice blind typing more. Typing in VR is a disaster, even though there's a pass-through feature. I cannot see the keyboard. I always want to see the keyboard through the hole in the nose position. Especially some password occasions.

More news, I found my passport is not expired, great news, so I can plan some abroad travels this year.

In the 2nd week, I will start some front-end coding.
