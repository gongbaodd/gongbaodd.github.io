# 6th week: Use AI & wifi-direct

My Mac is super lagged this week. After some research, I have to use wifi-direct in Immersed VR. Simple, if you have a PC, you can set up a hotspot and connect your Headset to the hotspot. But in Mac, the hotspot feature is used by airdrop. I can try the ethernet, and share the internet with the headset using wifi. Or I can buy a USB wifi adapter as a Wifi2.

I bought CF-812AC, using an opensource solution on Github written by [chris1111](https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter). The driver emulates the chip as an ethernet cable. It needs to disable SIP in recovery mode. In conclusion, The driver works fine, I can share my internet now, but in 2.4GHz. So the better idea is to add AP feature in the driver. It costs time... Now, I'm using a PC to set hotspot for the Mac and the headset.

About AI, I subscribed copilot this week. Yes, it may not replace my job, but someone with an AI will.
