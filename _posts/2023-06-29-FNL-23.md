# Friday Night Live 6-23

Welcome to the News quiz, recorded this week at the Hay Festival and with the Chelsea Flower Show also taking place this week, we hope finally to have a conclusive answer to the question, which is better, books or shrubs?

欢迎来到本周在干草节上录制的新闻测验，本周还将举行切尔西花卉展，我们希望最终对这个问题有一个决定性的答案，书籍还是灌木哪个更好？

What do you think, Hay? Well the final definitive verdict will be revealed at the end of this week's News quiz. Hello, I'm Andy Zotsam.

你怎么看，海伊？那么最终的最终裁决将在本周的新闻测验结束时揭晓。你好，我是安迪·佐察姆。

This show is taking place under the wachful fist of the new BBC Verify service, which alerts listeners to when something less than 100% true might be being broadcast, under the new system, as long as what I say is completely true, the sound of a mooing cow will be audible.

这个节目是在新的BBC Verify服务的拳头下进行的，该服务提醒听众，当播放的内容可能低于100%真实时，在新系统下，只要我说的是完全真实的，哞哞牛的声音就会被听到。

Point proved.

证明了。

In this Hay versus Chelsea week, pitting literature, some of which is very sad against gardening, our two teams this week, our team, Reeded and Weep, against Team Weeded and Reep.

在这个海伊对切尔西的一周里，把文学，其中一些是非常悲伤的，对抗园艺，我们这周的两个团队，我们的团队，里德和哭泣，对抗团队，除草和收割。

On Team Reeded, we have Lucy Porter and from the spectator Kate Andrews. On Team Weeded, it's Simon Evans and Robin Morgan.

在里德队，我们有露西·波特和观众凯特·安德鲁斯。 Team Weeded 的成员是西蒙·埃文斯 (Simon Evans) 和罗宾·摩根 (Robin Morgan)。

And to fit in with all the book-bothering novel-nuzzling literature lovers here in Hay, we are converting some of this week's news stories into different literary styles.

为了适应这里的所有书籍打扰小说蠕动文学爱好者，我们将本周的一些新闻故事转化为不同的文学风格。

I'll read a passage from a made-up novel. Our panelists then have to tell me what factual news stories are the fictional bits of fiction about.

我会读一段虚构的小说。然后我们的嘉宾要告诉我，哪些事实新闻故事是虚构的小说。

Now, to begin with, Kate and Lucy, your chosen literary style that I've chosen for you is detective story.

现在，首先，凯特和露西，我为你们选择的文学风格是侦探小说。

So, tell me, what is this excerpt about? What we have here, my dear Watson, said Holmes, is something that is going up and down at the same time.

那么，告诉我，这段摘录是关于什么的？我们在这里有什么，亲爱的沃森，福尔摩斯说，是一些在同一时间上下起伏的东西。

But Holmes, I replied, how can that be unless it's a donkey on a pogo stick? So, what is that story about?

但是，福尔摩斯，我回答说，除非它是一个在跳跃棒上的驴子，否则怎么可能呢？那么，这个故事是关于什么的？

Speaker2: Well, I suppose it's inflation, which is going up, only slower than it used to, like me getting out of a bath. Or what a big jagger's erections.

说话者2: 嗯，我想这是通货膨胀，通货膨胀正在上升，只是比以前慢，就像我从浴缸里出来一样。或者一个大的杰格的勃起。

How much empirical research have you done? I can't get no satisfaction, I mean. So, inflation, It's still absolutely nuts.

你做了多少实证研究？我不能得到满足，我的意思是。所以，通货膨胀，仍然是绝对的疯狂。

Some of the inflation statistics cheese is 39% more expensive than it was 12 months ago. Milk, 33% more than 12 months ago.

一些通货膨胀统计数据显示，奶酪比12个月前贵39%。牛奶比12个月前贵33%。

Granulated sugar, 47%, which is terrible news for me because all I ever eat is sweet, cheesy milkshakes.

粒状糖，47%，这对我来说是个可怕的消息，因为我吃的都是甜的，奶酪奶昔。

That's what makes jagger cosy as well as that.

这也是杰格舒适的原因。

Speaker1: Family show, everyone.

演讲者1: 全家秀，每个人。

Speaker3: Inflation is the one thing that arguably isn't the government's fault right now because the tools top control it are held by the Band of England.'

说话者3: 通货膨胀是唯一一件现在不是政府的错的事情，因为控制它的工具是由英格兰银行持有的。

And it's the one thing where Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunter, like we're going to make videos, we're going to make TikToks, and we're going to convince them that this is our fault.

这是唯一一件里希·苏纳克和杰里米·亨特都要做的事情，就像我们要制作视频，我们要制作TikToks，我们要说服他们，这是我们的错。

The rate of inflation is coming down. Do not be fooled. That means that prices are going up just at a slower pace. Your costs are not coming down.

通货膨胀率正在下降。不要被愚弄了。这意味着价格上涨的速度只是放缓了。你的成本没有下降。

Interest rates are going up to try to get people to save a bit more money, to try to take some demand out of the economy.

为了让人们多存一些钱，为了从经济中抽出一些需求，利率正在上升。

It's not going well. And everyone's just feeling that pinch from higher prices and higher interest rates.

这不是很好。每个人都感觉到了高物价和高利率带来的压力。

But great news is that the International Monetary Fund thinks we might not have a recession.

但是好消息是，国际货币基金组织认为我们可能不会陷入衰退。

To be very clear, the economy is not going to grow, but we might not have a recession. You are welcome.

非常清楚，经济不会增长，但我们可能不会陷入衰退。不客气。

Speaker2: I feel certainly a little bit sorry for the government if they are trying to do it, or even the Bank of England.

说话者2: 如果他们试图这样做，甚至是英格兰银行，我确实有点同情政府。

If you say they have the tools but it amounts to interest rate rise, you have to put interest rates up quite high for me to pause in front of the cheese counter and consider investing instead.

如果你说他们有工具，但这相当于利率上涨，你必须把利率提高到相当高的水平，我才会在奶酪柜台前停下来，考虑投资。
