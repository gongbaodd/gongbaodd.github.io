# 2nd week retrospective

This week I configured some bugs in my nvim preferences. Next week I will try to use it as my main editor.

Still working in VR, found some shortcoming when I switch devices. Wish there were an Immersed for multiple devices.

I need a better podcast app to synchronize between devices. And a virtual keyboard just show what I typed, yes it is too hard to do blind typing.

A Netflix comic is hilarious, called Inside Job. Tells a story about a company works on conspiracies. Sadly it was cut.
