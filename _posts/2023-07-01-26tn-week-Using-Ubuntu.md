## Ubuntu

This week I went back from PC to linux, because the weather is getting hotter, causing my PC to overheat.

ImmersedVR is compitable with Linux, just need to install libfuse2, and 
[v4l2loopback-dkms](https://installati.one/install-v4l2loopback-dkms-ubuntu-20-04/) for virtual camera. This is an [article](https://linux.how2shout.com/how-to-create-desktop-shortcut-for-an-appimage/) about add AppImage pacakge to favorite bar.

The input method, iBus, needs restart after installed.

Can use piper to config logitech mouse.

Keep using Xorg as display server is a good choice, most Apps, like xrandr are based on Xorg. Only Waydroid is not compitable with Xorg.

## ultra-copier

When copying files, some devices can be overheat.[ultra-copier](https://ultracopier.herman-brule.com/) can be used as a stable and fast copy tool.

## Text to speech

I'm using [OtterAI](https://otter.ai/home) to transpile podcasts to content. Using these scripts to practice English.

## Nx

I'm starting learning [react-babylon](https://brianzinn.github.io/react-babylonjs/) in a deep dive. Using Nx as a monorepo utility. I suggest this [tutorial](https://nx.dev/core-tutorial/01-create-blog).

keep remembering to add `package.json` and a name a version to the lib.

## JS animation library

[react spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/) supports react and threejs.

[framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) seems only support react.

Babylon has it's own animation system.

## ORM

[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/), suggested by Syntax FM. Haven't tried.
