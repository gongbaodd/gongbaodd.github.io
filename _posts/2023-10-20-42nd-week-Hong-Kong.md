# 42nd Week - Trip to Hong Kong & Macow

## Bankcards

I applied HSBC, BoCHK, ZA Bank, Livi Bank, And Bank and Airstar Bank. I didn't get a card from HSBC. The others are fine.

## Meta Quest 3

I bought Meta quest 3 in WanChai. The new mix reality feature is awesome.

## Macow Museum

Learned to be tolerance from a mile budda sculpture. There is a nice game in the museum.

## Hong Kong Museum of Culture

A show about Jin Yong is fun to watch.
